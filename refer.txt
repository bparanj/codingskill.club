	<h3>Asking Questions</h3>

	<p>
		The ability to ask questions is a skill and it is a prerequisite to solve problems. Ask:
	
		<ul>
			<li>What</li>
			<li>How</li>
			<li>Why</li>
		</ul>
	
		These questions will make you reason about the code and gain deeper understanding. Here is some questions to ask:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Wait a minute... How do you know that?</li>
			<li>How do you know that is the right X? Are you sure it is right?</li>
			<li>How do you recognize the type of problem?</li>
			<li>How do you get that?</li>
			<li>Why do you do that?</li>
			<li>So, what does that mean?</li>
			<li>That sounds pretty vague to me.</li>
			<li>Are you sure?</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>Reflection</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>
			What are the key ideas? 		
		</li>
		<li>
			What are some examples? 	
		</li>
		<li>
			How do these relate to what I already know?	
		</li>
		<li>
			What went well? 	
		</li>
		<li>
			What could have gone better? 	
		</li>
		<li>
			What might I need to learn for better mastery, or what strategies might I use the next time to get better results?
		</li>
	</ul>
