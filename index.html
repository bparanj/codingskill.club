            <h3>Your Personal Guide</h3>
						<p>
							For more than 10 years I have coached hundreds of developers to improve their software development skills. Coaching them live resulted in a book: TDD in Ruby that is now published by Apress.

<h3>Honing Your Coding Skills</h3>

<p>
	The ability to analyze complex material and solve problems is a skill — just like any other skill. However, there is a peculiar difficulty involved in teaching ana­lytical skills. Generally there are two phases to teaching a skill. 
</p>
 
 <p>
	 First, the skill is demonstrated to the student. Then, the student is guided and corrected while practicing. For example, golf is taught by showing the beginner how to grasp the club, how to place the feet, how to move the arms and body as one swings. The beginner can watch a golf pro — can even watch a slow motion film of the pro in action — and in this way learn the pro’s technique. Furthermore, the pro can observe the beginner at practice and point out flaws or demonstrate how to improve.
 	
 </p>

<p>
	In contrast to playing golf, analyzing complex material is an activity which is generally done inside your head. This makes it somewhat difficult for a teacher to teach and for a learner to learn. A beginner cannot observe how an expert thinks and solves problems. And the expert has trouble demonstrating technique to a beginning student.
