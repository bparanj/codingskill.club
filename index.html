            <h3>Your Personal Guide</h3>
						<p>
							For more than 10 years I have coached hundreds of developers to improve their software development skills. Coaching them live resulted in a book: TDD in Ruby that is now published by Apress.
						</p>

<h3>Honing Your Coding Skills</h3>

<p>
	The ability to analyze complex material and solve problems is a skill — just like any other skill. However, there is a peculiar difficulty involved in teaching ana­lytical skills. Generally there are two phases to teaching a skill. 
</p>
 
 <p>
	 First, the skill is demonstrated to the student. Then, the student is guided and corrected while practicing. For example, golf is taught by showing the beginner how to grasp the club, how to place the feet, how to move the arms and body as one swings. The beginner can watch a golf pro — can even watch a slow motion film of the pro in action — and in this way learn the pro’s technique. Furthermore, the pro can observe the beginner at practice and point out flaws or demonstrate how to improve.
 	
 </p>

<p>
	In contrast to playing golf, analyzing complex material is an activity which is generally done inside your head. This makes it somewhat difficult for a teacher to teach and for a learner to learn. A beginner cannot observe how an expert thinks and solves problems. And the expert has trouble demonstrating technique to a beginning student. 

</p> 
	<h4>Better Learning</h4>
	<p>
		Trying to come up with an answer rather than having it presented to you, or trying to solve a problem before being shown the solution, leads to <mark>better learning and longer retention of the correct solution</mark>, even when your attempted response is wrong, so long as corrective feedback is provided.
	</p>

<h4>Priming the Mind for Learning</h4>

<p>
When you’re asked to struggle with solving a problem before being shown how to solve it, the subsequent solution is better learned and more durably remembered. Unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem encourage deep processing of the answer when it is later supplied, creating fertile ground for its encoding, in a way that simply reading the answer cannot. <mark>See mistakes not as failures but as lessons and turning points along the path to mastery</mark>.

</p>

<ul>
	<li>It's better to solve a problem than to memorize a solution. </li>
	<li>It's better to attempt a solution and supply the incorrect answer than not to make the attempt.	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reflection</h4>

<ul>
	<li>
		What are the key ideas? 		
	</li>
	<li>
		What are some examples? 	
	</li>
	<li>
		How do these relate to what I already know?	
	</li>
	<li>
		What went well? 	
	</li>
	<li>
		What could have gone better? 	
	</li>
	<li>
		What might I need to learn for better mastery, or what strategies might I use the next time to get better results?
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to Apply the Pareto Principle to Interview Preparation</h4>

<p>
There is no need to work through all the 1500 problems from the coding interview platform. <mark>Find the critical 20% of those problems (about 300) that will give you 80% of the results</mark>. It's not possible to practice 1500 problems.
</p>
