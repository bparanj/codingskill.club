    <h3> How to Tackle Challenges You Face in Coding Problems  </h3>
    <p class="lead">  
		Did you know most developers who try to solve a coding problem fail miserably? It's true. For example Google has an acceptance rate of just 0.2%. That means 99.8% of the candidates failed! Some even lower their aim and settle for less by working for companies with toxic work environment!		
  	</p>
  
	<p class="lead">
		Here's the problem you face: most developers give up even before they start coding. Some even stare at the problem with no clue on how to code the solution.
	</p>		

	<p class="lead">
		Which means you'll never get a chance to work at your dream	company and never realize your full potential in your career.
	</p>
  
	<p class="lead">
  	  Luckily for you, there's now a solution. Let me introduce you to the Live Coding Pro, a brand new training program to guide you in acquiring problem solving skills and solve coding problems with confidence. You will hone your skills to construct algorithm for a given problem and code the solution from scratch.
  	</p>

   	<h3>Your Personal Guide</h3>
	<p class="lead">
	For more than 10 years I have coached hundreds of developers to improve their coding skills. Coaching them live resulted in a book: TDD in Ruby that is now published by Apress.

            <h3> Problem Solving Skills Mastery </h3>
			<p class='lead'> 
				We spend more time to highlight how we digested the problem and formulated the solution. You will learn about our thinking process so that you can replicate the same pattern or reason about the problem in a similar way. 
			</p>
			<p class='lead'>	
				We will go through the process of writing the code from scratch. You will understand the flow and how we solve the problem. We will go through the problem statement and come up with a solution step by step with explanation on our thought process. 				
			</p>
			<p class='lead'>
				You will understand how to attack problems effectively and reach correct solutions. Research has shown that accuracy and thoroughness are mental habits which can be cultivated through training and exercise.

	<h3>Honing Your Coding Skills</h3>

	<p class='lead'>
		The ability to analyze complex material and solve problems is a skill — just like any other skill. However, there is a peculiar difficulty involved in teaching ana­lytical skills. Generally there are two phases to teaching a skill. 
	</p>
 
	 <p class='lead'>
		 First, the skill is demonstrated to the student. Then, the student is guided and corrected while practicing. For example, golf is taught by showing the beginner how to grasp the club, how to place the feet, how to move the arms and body as one swings. 
	</p>	 
	<p class='lead'>	 
		 The beginner can watch a golf pro — can even watch a slow motion film of the pro in action — and in this way learn the pro’s technique. Furthermore, the pro can observe the beginner at practice and point out flaws or demonstrate how to improve.
	 </p>

	<p class='lead'>
		In contrast to playing golf, analyzing complex material is an activity which is generally done inside your head. This makes it somewhat difficult for a teacher to teach and for a learner to learn. A beginner cannot observe how an expert thinks and solves problems. And the expert has trouble demonstrating technique to a beginning student. 
	</p> 
		<h3>Better Learning</h3>
		<p class='lead'>
			Trying to come up with an answer rather than having it presented to you, or trying to solve a problem before being shown the solution, leads to <mark>better learning and longer retention of the correct solution</mark>, even when your attempted response is wrong, so long as corrective feedback is provided.
		</p>

	<h3>Priming the Mind for Learning</h3>

	<p class='lead'>
	When you’re asked to struggle with solving a problem before being shown how to solve it, the subsequent solution is better learned and more durably remembered. 
	</p>
	<p class='lead'>
	Unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem encourage deep processing of the answer when it is later supplied, creating fertile ground for its encoding, in a way that simply reading the answer cannot. <mark>See mistakes not as failures but as lessons and turning points along the path to mastery</mark>.
	</p>

	<ul class='lead'>
		<li> <span>&#10003;</span>
			It's better to solve a problem than to memorize a solution. 
		</li>
		<li> <span>&#10003;</span>
			It's better to attempt a solution and supply the incorrect answer than not to make the attempt.	
		</li>
	</ul>

  				Masterminds are small groups of people that have similar experiences, challenges, and trajectories in their learning journey. Quite simply put, they are the embodiment of the phrase: Two (or three) minds are better than one.
				
  			</p>
			
			<p class='lead'>
				By surrounding yourself with folks that can provide you with informed advice, feedback during practice and critical constructive feedback on your failures in a safe space — you are just setting yourself up with both the resources and guidance you need to focus on building your problem solving skills.
			</p>
			<p class='lead'>
				Napoleon Hill mentions that the convergence of two individual minds creates a third, invisible force that combines the strength of both of its components. When you share your weaknesses and strengths with other people, you magnify your own experience and make it the experience of those around you. 
			</p>	
			<p class='lead'>	
				The power that comes from those shared experiences can be just as compelling and empowering as your individual success.

	<h4>Four Stages in Skills Progression</h4>
	<p class='lead'>
		Automaticity is the ability to do things without occupying the mind with the low-level details required, allowing it to become an automatic response pattern or habit. It is usually the result of learning, repetition and practice. There are four stages in skills progression.	
	</p>
	
  	<p><img src="https://www.codingskill.net/assets/images/skills.jpg" alt="Skills Progression" /></p>
	
	<h4>How to Apply the Pareto Principle to Interview Preparation</h4>

	<p class='lead'>
	There is no need to work through all the 1500 problems from the coding interview platform. <mark>Find the critical 20% of those problems (about 300) that will give you 80% of the results</mark>. It's not possible to practice 1500 problems.
	</p>

	<h3>How it Works</h3>

	<p class='lead'>
		You can be the driver, share your screen and type in the code on the keyboard. Others will guide you in coding the solution and answer your questions if you are stuck. By thinking out aloud, you practice the same skill that is needed during a whiteboard interview. 
	</p>	
	<p class='lead'>	
		You can also be an active observer by watching others work through the problems and how they solve coding problems. You can ask questions at any time if something is not clear to you. You can get all your doubts clarified.
	</p>
	<ul class='lead'>
		<li><span>&#10003;</span>
			We have created a safe environment to fail (no one will judge you)
		</li>
		<li><span>&#10003;</span>
			Learn from failures so we don't make the same mistakes (keep improving)
		</li>
		<li><span>&#10003;</span>
			You can be at any skill level to participate
		</li>
		<li><span>&#10003;</span>
			Code from scratch by starting from the problem statement
		</li>
		<li><span>&#10003;</span>
			Summarize key takeaways at the end of the session
		</li>
		<li><span>&#10003;</span>
			Make a list of questions and get your doubts clarified
		</li>
		<li><span>&#10003;</span>
			Be a good listener and learn from other developer's reasoning skills
		</li>
	</ul>
